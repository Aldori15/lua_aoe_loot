## Prerequisites

I would recommend using [my fork](https://github.com/Aldori15/mod-eluna) of mod-eluna as that has the necessary Eluna changes and is pretty much plug and play. However, if you would like to use a different mod-eluna repo, you will need to be updated to at least [commit 5077a42](https://github.com/azerothcore/mod-eluna/commit/5077a429cce54e1b7d43e8e1f143b901adc26235) or newer.  But if you are cherry picking specific commits, then at the very least you need the aforementioned commit and also these two commits: [commit de84ed1](https://github.com/azerothcore/mod-eluna/commit/de84ed13695f04e90feae49ba2a74106f3da8add) and [commit 972879c](https://github.com/azerothcore/mod-eluna/commit/972879c69656f0f73d09d974c6fe55382a677f4d).  So in other words, you can use my fork of mod-eluna, update to the latest of Azerothcore's mod-eluna, or cherry pick the 3 mentioned commits.

For TrinityCore, use the provided `.diff` file to add the needed methods, ensuring full functionality.

## üöÄ Installation

1. Download the `aoe_loot.lua` script.
2. Download the `aoe_loot_aio.lua` script if you use [AIO](https://github.com/Rochet2/AIO), or download the `aoe_loot_csmh.lua` script if you use [CSMH](https://github.com/Foereaper/CSMH).
3. Place both scripts in your `lua_scripts` directory.  You can use a subfolder within that directory if you want.

## üéÆ Usage

Enable via the Interface options in-game, which allows for looting multiple nearby corpses simultaneously.
