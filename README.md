## Prerequisites

For AzerothCore, make sure your mod-eluna is updated to at least [commit 972879c](https://github.com/azerothcore/mod-eluna/commit/972879c69656f0f73d09d974c6fe55382a677f4d) or newer.  But if you are cherry picking, then at the very least you need the aforementioned commit and also [commit de84ed1](https://github.com/azerothcore/mod-eluna/commit/de84ed13695f04e90feae49ba2a74106f3da8add). 

For TrinityCore, use the provided `.diff` file to add the needed methods, ensuring full functionality.

## 🚀 Installation

1. Download the `aoe_loot.lua` script.
2. Download the `aoe_loot_aio.lua` script if you use [AIO](https://github.com/Rochet2/AIO), or download the `aoe_loot_csmh.lua` script if you use [CSMH](https://github.com/Foereaper/CSMH).
3. Place both scripts in your `lua_scripts` directory.  You can use a subfolder within that directory if you want.

## 🎮 Usage

Enable via the Interface options in-game, which allows for looting multiple nearby corpses simultaneously.
